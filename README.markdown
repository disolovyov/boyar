Boyar is a joke programming language taking after [LOLCODE](http://lolcode.com/), but mocking the langue of the medieval Russian aristocracy instead of lolcats.
The syntax was inspired by a Russian Internet meme “[Боярский язык](http://lurkmore.ru/%D0%91%D0%BE%D1%8F%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA)”.

This project was created as coursework for the “Compiler Design” class at [Transport and Telecommunication Institute](http://www.tsi.lv/?lang=en).

Details and example usage can be found at the [project wiki](http://wiki.github.com/dimituri/boyar/).
